# Word Embeddings
Neural networks have allowed us to create more flexible and expressive word representations than frequency-based methods like term-frequency or tf-idf, and modern computing has gone even further to allow us to use representations that change based on linguistic context. In this assignment, you will use the HackerNews dataset created in the Module 1 assignment to:
- Build static embeddings by training Word2Vec
- Build contextual embeddings with a sentence-transformer (BERT-family)
- Perform EDA on embeddings
- Train a simple classifier (logistic regression) on each embedding type to predict a lightweight label from story titles


## Instructions

1. Create a repository under your GitHub account from this template: [https://github.com/amarbut/ADS-509-mod3](https://github.com/amarbut/ADS-509-mod3). Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template). Make your repository [private](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility) and add your instructorâ€™s GitHub account as a [collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/how-tos/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository). 
2. Follow the provided Jupyter Notebook like a worksheet, completing all of the **TODO** items in the provided code cells and answering all of the written questions (marked **Q**) in the provided markdown cells. DO NOT create your own notebook or .py file from scratch, as this inevitably leads to missed instructions or questions and complicates grading.
3. When you have finished your code, print your notebook as a PDF and submit it in Canvas. 
4. Commit your code, push the changes to GitHub, and include a link to your repo in your Canvas submission note so your instructor has access to the .ipynb notebook files and any other code you create.
