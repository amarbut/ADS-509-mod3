I tried VibeVoice-1.5B on my old CPU with torch.float32 and it took 832 seconds to generate a 66 second audio clip. Switching from torch.bfloat16 also introduced some weird sound artifacts in the audio output. If you're GPU-poor the best TTS model I've tried so far is Kokoro.

45115004,John Coltrane's Tone Circle,45116838,rectang,"A few months ago, I was studying Giant Steps and I came across the “Giant Steps is actually very simple (yes, really)” video by Dave Pollack. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xd75Mwo4JNo Pollack argues that the main reason that Giant Steps is such a high mountain is because it is traditionally played at such a ferocious tempo. Slow it down, and the Coltrane Changes become fairly ordinary ii-V-I substitution progressions. I’m persuaded. I love Coltrane, and I’ve listened to the Giant Steps album countless times.

My take on the ""special something"" that causes people to care about implementation is that you want to specifically control parts of a computer.  Yes, this is typically for run-time performance; but crucially it is because you want to specifically reason about what the computer will be doing to implement your program.  And the more that your computer is capable of doing, the more you are likely to care about different aspects of how it executes. I'd hazard this goes both ways, too.  That is, it is not just in terms of how much the computer is capable of doing, but what the real world systems being modeled can do.  For a fun example, you can make a sorting network that can sort integers on a computer rapidly, but that doesn't necessarily help you sort a physical quantity of anything.  Is akin to making a computer that can win a game of chess, but only if the human moves the pieces for it. All too often, people present programs as if they are truths independent of either model or computer.  Which is doubly wrong as they are constrained by the model of the language they are implemented in, as well as being dependent on the model of whatever problem they are describing. reply","fun read. my take on the ""special something"" that causes people to care about implementation is that you want to specifically control parts of a computer. yes, this is typically for run-time performance; but crucially it is because you want to specifically reason about what the computer will be doing to implement your program. and the more that your computer is capable of doing, the more you are likely to care about different aspects of how it executes. i'd hazard this goes both ways, too. that is, it is not just in terms of how much the computer is capable of doing, but what the real world systems being modeled can do. for a fun example, you can make a sorting network that can sort integers on a computer rapidly, but that doesn't necessarily help you sort a physical quantity of anything. is akin to making a computer that can win a game of chess, but only if the human moves the pieces for it. all too often, people present programs as if they are truths independent of either model or computer. which is doubly wrong as they are constrained by the model of the language they are implemented in, as well as being dependent on the model of whatever problem they are describing. reply","['fun', 'read', 'take', 'special', 'something', 'causes', 'people', 'care', 'implementation', 'want', 'specifically', 'control', 'parts', 'computer', 'yes', 'typically', 'runtime', 'performance', 'crucially', 'want', 'specifically', 'reason', 'computer', 'implement', 'program', 'computer', 'capable', 'likely', 'care', 'different', 'aspects', 'executes', 'hazard', 'goes', 'ways', 'terms', 'computer', 'capable', 'real', 'world', 'systems', 'modeled', 'fun', 'example', 'make', 'sorting', 'network', 'sort', 'integers', 'computer', 'rapidly', 'necessarily', 'help', 'sort', 'physical', 'quantity', 'anything', 'akin', 'making', 'computer', 'win', 'game', 'chess', 'human', 'moves', 'pieces', 'often', 'people', 'present', 'programs', 'truths', 'independent', 'either', 'model', 'computer', 'doubly', 'wrong', 'constrained', 'model', 'language', 'implemented', 'well', 'dependent', 'model', 'whatever', 'problem', 'describing', 'reply']",0.9734

Unfortunately, if you expect what you see in the marketing materials, you’ll be disappointed. Cameras tend to either be unable to see the glow, or blow it way out of proportion. They are quite a bit above your typical glowing fungus though. They can also be kinda finicky to grow until you learn what they need. Basically: -Full sun. Internode length directly correlates with light received. I can make them “leggy” or ultra dense with my adjustable lights. -Prefer cooler temperatures. They don’t seem to like high 80’s to 90’s. Seem to prefer 60-70 degrees F -They happily survive the winter while inside, and can survive multiple years.

Straight potting soil will hold too much moisture for too long, causing root rot. -Prefer bigger and deeper pots, like 10+”. I’d consider 6” the minimum -Like being spoon fed fertilizer with waterings. Jack’s petunia feed is perfect. -May be slightly sensitive to chlorine/chloramine in tap water.

I’ll occasionally remove 1/3rd to 2/3rds of their top mass. This also has the benefit of removing weight from the initially thin and weak stems (which thicken over time). -Can be crossed with other petunias, and sometimes even tobacco. Note that pigments in the flowers from other petunia varieties block the glow, so they’ll be dimmer. -Wild petunias (or whatever the ancestor plants are) rely on moths for pollination. You can get lots of seeds by manually pollinating the flowers. -They tend to emit more fragrance at night (for attracting moths) -The newest growth is the brightest, in particular the recently developed flowers that haven’t opened yet which truly look “glowing”.

less ideal situations and associated methods of mark corrections,

Using both CF and SD cards simultaneously, it can record at about 145MB/s, so you can get very high quality footage. Re what we can support - it's a reverse engineering project, we can support anything with enough time ;)  The very newest cams have software changes that make enabling ML slightly harder for normal users, but don't make much difference from a developer perspective.  I don't see any signs of Canon trying to lock out reverse engineers.  Gaining access and doing a basic, ML GUI but no features port, is not hard when you have experience. What we choose to support: I work on the cams that I have.  And the cams that I have are whatever I find for cheap, so it's pretty random.  Other devs have whatever priorities they have :) The first cam I ported to was 200D, unsupported at the time.  This took me a few months to get ML GUI working (with no features enabled), and I had significant help.  Now I can get a new cam to that standard in a few days in most cases.  All the cams are fairly similar for the core OS.  It's the peripherals that change the most as hardware improves, so this takes the most time.  And the newer the camera, the more the hw and sw has diverged from the best supported cams. The cheapest way for you to get started is to use your 5D3 - which you can do in our fork of qemu.  You can dump the roms (using software, no disassembly required), then emulate a full Canon and ML GUI, which can run your custom ML changes.  There are limitations, mostly around emulation of peripherals.  It's still very useful if you want to improve / customise the UI. https://github.com/reticulatedpines/qemu-eos/tree/qemu-eos-v... Re docs - they're not in a great shape.  It's scattered over a few different wikis, a forum, and commit messages in multiple repos.  Quick discussion happens on Discord.  We're very responsive there, it's the best place for dev questions.  The forum is the best single source for reference knowledge.  From a developer perspective, I have made some efforts on a Dev Guide, but it's far from complete, e.g.: https://github.com/reticulatedpines/magiclantern_simplified/...

45078315,Magic Lantern Is Back,45118849,fooker,"> turn the cam itself into a star tracker Hmm, that's a neat idea. The better language for it is 'auto guider'. Auto guiding is basically supplying correction information to the mount when it drifts off. Most mounts support guiding input and virtually all astrophotographers set up a separate tiny camera, a small scope, and a laptop to auto guide the mount. It would be neat for the main camera to do it. The caveat is that this live view sampling would add extra noise to the main images (more heat, etc). But in my opinion, the huge boost in convenience would make that worth it, given that modern post processing is pretty good for mitigating noise. The signals that have to be sent to the mount are pretty simple too, so I'll look at this at some point in future. The bottleneck for me is that I have ever got 'real' auto guiding to work reliably with my mount so if I run into issues it would be tricky as there's no baseline working version. > Maybe an auto image upload service?

  It is not complete (in ML hardly anything is) but allows to access a lot of ML and Canon functions. Years ago someone made a script for automating solar eclipse shooting catching all critical phases while chilling and enjoying the view.
- Introduced full electronic shutter (Silent Pic) for Digic 4 and 5. 
- Focus stacking for macro and - via Lua script - for landscape.
- Exposure simulation switch for ""cheaper"" cams
- Trap focus
- Dual-ISO. Some HDR mode but without ghosting by manipulating sensor lines to record  at different ISOs
- Ghost image overlay
- Customizable cropmark overlays (grids and others)
- Fps finetuning. Several folks used it to record vintage monitors with very, very strange timings and without rolling bars.30.01 fps? No problem!
- Zebras and focus peaking, vectorscope, wavelength monitoring, false colour support
- RAW histogram
- Bracketing with up to 11 frames (But why? ;-> ) 
- Intervalometer and bracketing (a bit more configurable than Canon has now)
- Trigger by LCD's IR sensor (if any) or Audio (clap your hand) or motion detect 
- Rack focus
- Display mirroring and upside/down options
- Configurable presets (up to 15)
- 30 minutes override for RAW recording, USB and HDMI streaming. Oh, and we have a new option to record native H.264/MOV for more than 29:59. Prototype but working.

    =============

    Magic Lantern (ML) is a software enhancement that offers increased
    functionality to the excellent Canon DSLR cameras.
      
    It's an open framework, licensed under GPL, for developing extensions to the
    official firmware.

    Magic Lantern is not a *hack*, or a modified firmware, **it is an
    independent program that runs alongside Canon's own software**. 
    Each time you start your camera, Magic Lantern is loaded from your memory
    card. Our only modification was to enable the ability to run software
    from the memory card.

    ML is being developed by photo and video enthusiasts, adding
    functionality such as: HDR images and video, timelapse, motion
    detection, focus assist tools, manual audio controls much more.

    For more details on Magic Lantern please see [http://www.magiclantern.fm/](http://www.magiclantern.fm/)

    There is a sibling repo for our patched version of Qemu that adds support
    for emulating camera ROMs. This allows testing without access to a physical
    camera, and automating tests across a suite of cameras.

45114753,"MIT Study Finds AI Use Reprograms the Brain, Leading to Cognitive Decline",45116312,pessimizer,"> We're not because you have to still check every outputted code. To me, that's what makes it an abstraction layer, rather than just a servant or an employee. You have to break your entire architecture into units small enough that you know you can coax the machine to output good code for. The AI can't be trusted as far as you can throw it, but the distance from you to how far you can throw is the abstraction layer. An employee you can just tell to make it work, they'll kill themselves trying to do it, or be replaced if they don't; eventually something will work, and you'll take all the credit for it. AI is not experimenting, learning and growing, it stays stupid. The longer it thinks, the wronger it thinks. You deserve the credit (and the ridicule) for everything it does that you put your name on. ----- edit: and this thread seems to think that you don't have to check what your high level abstraction is doing. That's probably why most programs run like crap. You can't expect something you do in e.g. python to do the most algorithmically sensible thing, even if you wrote the algorithm just like the textbook said. It may make weird choices (maybe optimal for the general case, but horrifically bad for yours) that mean that it's not really running your cute algorithm at all, or maybe your cute algorithm is being starved by another thread that you have no idea why it would be dependent on. It may have made correct choices when you started writing, then decided to make wrong choices after a minor patch version change. To pretend perfection is a necessary condition for abstraction is not even somebody would say directly. Never. All we talk about is leaky abstractions.

They will copy examples very closely, following best practices blindly, or get someone else to make the critical design decisions. This can get you surprisingly far, but it’s also dangerous because the further past your understanding you are operating, the more you might have to learn all at once in order to fix something when it breaks. Debugging challenges all your assumptions, and if you don’t have models of what the pieces are and how they interact, it’s incredibly hard to start building them when something is already broken.

After using ChatGPT for a while you develop somewhat of an instinct for when it might be hallucinating, especially when you start probing it for the ""why"" part and you get a feel for whether its explanations make sense. Having at least some domain knowledge helps too - you're more at risk of being fooled by hallucinations if you are trying to get it to do something you know nothing about. While not foolproof, when you combine this with some basic fact-checking (e.g. quickly skim read a command's man page to make sure the explanation for each flag sounds right, or read the relevant paragraph from the manual) plus the fact that you see in practice whether the proposed solution fixes the problem, you can reach a reasonably high level of accuracy most of the time. Even with the risk of hallucinations it's still a great time saver because you short-circuit the process of needing to work out which command is useful and reading the whole of the man page / manual until you understand which component parts do the job you want.

""Use it or lose it"" may be a cliche, but it's true; if you don't keep some faculty conditioned, it gets ""rusty"". That's the general principle, so it would be surprising if this were an exception. The age of social media and constant distraction already atrophies the ability to maintain sustained focus. Who reads a book these days, never mind a thick book requiring struggle to master? That requires immersion, sustained engagement, persevering through discomfort, and denying yourself indulgence in all sorts of temptations and enticements to get a cheap fix. It requires postponed gratification, or a gratification that is more subtle and measured and piecemeal rather than some sharp spike. We become conditioned in Pavlovian fashion, more habituated to such behavior, the more we engage in such behavior. The reliance on AI for writing is partly rooted in the failure to recognize that writing is a form of engagement with the material. Clear writing is a way of developing knowledge and understanding. It helps uncover what you understand and what you don't. If you can't explain something, you don't know it well enough to have clear ideas about it. What good does an AI do you - you as a knowing subject - if it does the ""writing"" for you? You, personally, don't become wiser or better. You don't become fit by watching others exercise. This isn't to say AI has no purpose, but our attitude toward technology is often irresponsible. We think that if we have the power to do something, we are missing out by not using it. This is boneheaded. The ultimate measure is whether the technology is good for you in some particular use case. Sometimes, we make prudential allowances for practical reasons.

You can kill the script via SSH. What I'm planning to do is to build a simple daemon for each box, that checks in once per minute or so, to ask if it's time to shut down. Once everyone is clear, cut the power.

It may be dangerous, plus the battery may die pretty quickly. My first idea, to mitigate risk of fire, it’s possible to locate some hand made sand bag above the phone, so in case there’s fire, the sand would neutralise it. Also, I’d try to emulate charge-discharge cycles by enabling and disabling smart socket. I wonder if that’s possible to automate using the phone itself. E.g. when it reaches 20% it enables smart charger, and disables it upon reaching 80%. So it can do it in perpetuity. Since the screen would be off all the time, I guess one charging cycle would be once a few days. Which is twice or thrice better than average user who charges their phone once or even twice a day. So, theoretically, a Pixel with a new battery might survive a few years, if not 5 years, off one battery. Then a user might replace the battery. So, theoretically, rubbing it a server is entirely possible, I guess. Otherwise, super cool. I’d love to try this myself now. I guess that may be a perfect solar-powered server.

45107962,A staff engineer's journey with Claude Code,45116205,MontyCarloHall,"This is a great conference talk, thanks for sharing! To summarize, the authors enlisted a panel of expert developers to review the quality of various pull requests, in terms of architecture, readability, maintainability, etc. (see 8:27 in the video for a partial list of criteria), and then somehow aggregate these criteria into an overall ""productivity score."" They then trained a model on the judgments of the expert developers, and found that their model had a high correlation with the experts' judgment. Finally, they applied this model to PRs across thousands of codebases, with knowledge of whether the PR was AI-assisted or not. They found a 35-40% productivity gain for easy/greenfield tasks, 10-15% for hard/greenfield tasks, 15-20% for easy/brownfield tasks, and 0-10% for hard/brownfield tasks. Most productivity gains went towards ""reworked"" code, i.e. refactoring of recent code. All in all, this is a great attempt at rigorously quantifying AI impact. However, I do take one major issue with it. Let's assume that their ""productivity score"" does indeed capture the overall quality of a PR (big assumption). I'm not sure this measures the overall net positive/negative impact to the codebase. Just because a PR is well-written according to a panel of expert engineers doesn't mean it's valuable to the project as a whole.

I’ve noticed colleagues who enjoy Claude code are more interested in “just ship it!” (and anecdotally are more extroverted than myself). I find Claude code to be oddly unsatisfying. Still trying to put my finger on it, but I think it’s that I quickly lose context. Even if I understand the changes CC makes, it’s not the same as wrestling with a problem and hitting roadblocks and overcoming. With CC I have no bearing on whether I’m in an area of code with lots of room for error, or if I’m standing in the edge of a cliff and can’t cross some line in the design. I’m way more concerned with understanding the design and avoiding future pain than my “ship it” colleagues (and anecdotally am way more introverted). I see what they build and, yes, it’s working, for now, but the table relationships aren’t right and this is going to have to be rebuilt later, except now it’s feeding a downstream report that’s being consumed by the business, so the beta version is now production. But the 20 other things this app touches indirectly weren’t part of the vibe coding context, so the design obviously doesn’t account for that. It could, but of course the “ship it” folks aren’t the ones that are going to build out lengthy requirements and scopes of work and document how a dozen systems relate to and interact with each other. I guess I’m seeing that the speed limit of quality is still the speed of my understanding, and (maybe more importantly) that my weaponizing of my own obsession only works when I’m wrestling and overcoming, not just generating code as fast as possible.

The exact skill you mentioned - can visualize the plan for a change quickly - is what makes my LLM usage so powerful, imo. I can say the right precise wording in my prompt to guide it to a good plan very quickly. As the other commenter mentioned, the entire above process only takes something like 30-120 minutes depending on scope, and then I can generate code in a few minutes that would take 2-6 weeks to write myself, working 8 hr days.

There are key differences though that are worth highlighting. The main difference is that with the current batch of genai tools, the AI's context resets after use, whereas a (good) intern truly learns from prior behavior. Additionally, as you point out, the language and frameworks need to be part of the training set since AI isn't really ""learning"" it's just prepolulating a context window for its pre-existing knowledge (token prediction), so ymmv depending on hidden variables from the secret (to you, the consumers) training data and weights. I use Ruby primarily these days, which is solidly in the ""boring tech"" camp and most AIs fail to produce useful output that isn't rails boilerplate.

I find it difficult to include examples because a lot of my work is boring backend work on existing closed-source applications. It's hard to share, but I'll give it a go with a few examples :) ---- First example: Our quota detection system (shipped last month) handles configurable threshold detection across billing metrics. The business logic is non-trivial, distinguishing counter vs gauge metrics, handling multiple consumers, and efficient SQL queries across time windows. Claude's evolution:
 - First pass: Completely wrong approach (DB triggers)
 - Second pass: Right direction, wrong abstraction
 - Third pass: Working implementation, we could iterate on ----
Second example: Sentry monitoring wrapper for cron jobs, a reusable component to help us observe our cronjob usage Claude's evolution:
 - First pass: Hard-coded the integration into each cron job, a maintainability nightmare.
 - Second pass: Using a wrapper, but the config is all wrong

45107962,A staff engineer's journey with Claude Code,45116057,vincent_builds,"Author here, quick clarification on pricing: the $1000-1500/month is for Teams/Enterprise with higher rate limits, not the consumer MAX plans. Consumer MAX ($200/month) works for lighter usage but hits limits quickly with parallel agents and large codebases. For context: that's 1-2% of a senior engineer's fully loaded cost. The ROI is clear if it delivers even 10% productivity gain (we're seeing 2-3x on specific tasks). You're right that many devs can start with MAX plans.

From past experience, vendors like SuperMicro aren't much cheaper at scale because Dell can give 80% discounts on volume, and most Dell server sales are done via Channel with an MSP who will manage and administer the system. Ofc, this continues to reinforce my belief that the ""AI boom"" in it's current form (and once you remove the scooby doo monster mask) is basically a ""Datacenter/Telecom Bubble"" 2.0 like back in 2000-01. The multiples, messaging, vendors, and margins are almost the exact same. During the Dot-com Boom, Telecom and hardware companies were also expanding DC and telecom capacity massively (to surf and host a website on the Internet, you kinda need Internet and web hosting), and when the Dotbomb happened, the Telco bubble collapsed subsequently as well (remember WorldCom/MCI?) That's why the 2000s were horrible for anyone with a CS/CE/CSE/EE degree, because both software AND hardware industries collapsed.

What you are specifically looking at is the scenario where there is a) an AI bubble in the public markets (remember, much of AI of it is marked numbers in the VC world) and b) the possible scenario where the grey swan gets big enough and the risk of violent unwind is high enough to where you see arguable value in shifting to defensive positioning in a somewhat diversified portfolio. I'll assume you are weighted heavy to QQQ/NASDAQ in the portfolio. If you have a truly diversified portfolio with rules for systematic rebalancing, you never manually shift to defensive (obviously what I and most advisors would recommend). The first note is that an ""AI bubble"" in public markets, assuming there is one, is very much tied to the overall state of high market concentration in the trillion dollar tech names. To see a violent AI bubble unwind, it will almost necessarily involve the ""concentration bubble""/Nifty 50 2.0 unwinding as well. That means the AI Bubble narrative in public markets is tied to overall market liquidity just as much as the AI specific factors. The passive complex will put a large continual bid in for NVDA/GOOGL/AMZN/etc even in the case of an AI downturn, which should neutralize the violent unwind scenario unless both impulses turn negative (active money moving out of AI, and passive money pulling out of broad based ETFs entirely). Of course the relationship above is reflexive, which is to say that NVDA gapping 20% down on earnings may well spur wider outflows (as you personally alluded to when your response would be to ""go full defensive in my portfolio""), and vice versa. So what you want to be watching is specifically for signs of this contagion spreading. If liquidity/flows strongly turns negative, the concentration bubble unwinds, NVDA and co tank, and that likely triggers a sell-off in the AI speculative names and qualifies as an ""AI Bubble Burst"". Therefore you want to be watching general economic weakness like recession signals, layoffs, etc. Bond yields blowing out will also likely kill the AI bubble, as it's capital intensive. Even with the fortress balance sheets of the hyperscalers, the long end blowing out (it's starting to press into dangerous territory currently) would likely kill a hypothetical ""AI Bubble"". So watch bond yields (and bond volatility / MOVE index). More specific areas I would be watching is Hyperscaler Capex projections in earnings calls (watch it like a hawk), and some aspects of the trade war such as global digital services taxes in particular (because profit shocks for hyperscalers will likely result in reduced capex to preserve their earnings targets). I would also be watching competition for NVIDIA in the more grey swan areas, like Huwawei revealing a chip with twice the performance per watt as NVDA chips for half the price, and a surprise software stack that kicks ass (so the low single digit outcome areas regarding Chinese competition particularly, which wouldn't actually be bad for AI, but would likely result in a shock move of money leaving US related AI names on public markets, which would be a repeat of the February to April move we saw earlier this year in response to DeepSeek. Markets have memory.) So let's sketch out some risks over the next few years. Now we get to the part that usually adds little to no value (making predictions about where markets will go). Hint: nobody can do this broadly. Sometimes one may have specific value-adding strong convictions picked out of the universe of possibilities, but those are the exceptions. I'll even put a % chance guess since that's what you're looking for, but it adds literally no value. Bonds blowing out: low/moderate likelihood. 15-20% over the next few years for a major bond event imo, and I'd carry that directly to a 20% chance of an AI unwind. Heavy economic downturn: moderately likely. 25% or so. And since the scenarios overlap somewhat (stagflation would involve both, and it's a leading wider risk currently), let's move the risk to 30%. But remember that this is a risk scenario that will involve market cap weighted passive indexes as well, so we're really talking about market downturn risk rather than just the AI Bubble popping concurrently, since the latter is less meaningful in comparison even when we're focusing on portfolios. Now on to the AI specific scenarios, which would be AI falling out of favor with consumers. I personally put this under 5%, so I have strong conviction this won't be the case. I'm mostly disregarding this risk. Most would probably put it closer to 20%, and some would be 50/50 if they think it's a fad. You will find a wide array of predictions here. How about tech industry specific shocks like global digital services taxes causing a sharp drop in AI investment from the huge balance sheets driving it all? I think it's fairly unlikely as well, maybe 5-10% or so. I have high certainty that Google and Apple in particular are going to have great cashflow for the next few years. There are some side-lines to watch here though. Ex: the US government itself is strongly fending off digital services taxes in trade negotiations and using a big stick, but if the tariffs are confirmed to be nullified (recent court ruling), and tariffs are unwound, the world may use the opportunity to tax the multinational American tech companies while the US is stunned and weak, so to speak, especially if some of the other lines are playing out like bond yields getting dangerous, which puts pressure on global govs to raise revenue. That's an example of the sort of thinking that is required to really position a portfolio for things like esoteric crashes in specific sectors and have positive expectancy. You have to take into account all of these self-reinforcing feedback loops and get creative/contrarian to some degree, and find out where the market may be underpriced/offer value hedges and hidden synergistic correlations. Or you can pay up for generic tail protection/put options, and just pay the tax to cover the risk. In your case, perhaps that would be a good option? Just pay up for a put spread on NVIDIA that has a 10 to 1 payout ratio, spend 0.5% of your portfolio, and hey, you get a 5% payout in the case of an AI unwind (you don't need to go overboard, a 5% cash payout is a huge gift in a market crash while most are in panic). On NVIDIA in particular. I do think there's a moderate risk that NVIDIA is in an outright bubble currently. I could easily see a scenario where guidance comes in weak, margins come down for some reason (even something like a string of bad tape-outs at TSMC... could be anything), and NVIDIA re-rates lower. That would be painful for the entire market, and this is the risk I would be paying up to hedge (I'm currently hedging this a bit). I think there's a good 1/3 chance that NVIDIA tanks sometime over the next few years, but half of these scenarios would just be contained to NVIDIA and more to do with margins coming down to earth a bit (wow, this is quite nice just to be able to conjure up BS % numbers like that). ____________________________________ So in closing, just worry about having a properly diversified portfolio that self-rebalances according to proven rules. Ask yourself if there was an AI unwind, how would my portfolio look, and does this aligns with my financial goals and risk tolerance? Also ask yourself what would happen if it further picked up steam, since upside risk/opportunity cost is important as well. As previously mentioned, you are concerned with a scenario that closely correlates to index concentration as well, so also ask yourself how it looks if the current market leaders perform badly, and other sectors/market factors drive performance going forwards. reply","i'll give this a shot, as i spend my days managing a portfolio exposed to sector rotations on the mid-length timeframe.

45072481,TPDE-LLVM: Faster LLVM -O0 Back-End,45113380,testdelacc1,"LLVM is the code generation backend used in several languages, like Rust and one of the many compilers for C and C++ (clang). Code generated by these compilers is considered “fast/performant” thanks to LLVM. The problem with LLVM has always been that it takes a long time to produce code. The post in the link promises a new backend that produces a slower artifact, but does so 10-20x quicker. This is great for debug builds. This doesn’t mean the compilation as a whole gets quicker. There are 3 steps in compilation - Front end: transforms source code into an LLVM intermediation representation (IR) - Backend: this is where LLVM comes in. It accepts LLVM IR and transforms it into machine code - Linking: a separate program links the artifacts produced by LLVM. How long does each step take? Really depends on the program we’re trying to compile. This blog post contains timings for one example program ( https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/11/09/parallel-rustc/ ) to give you an idea. It also depends on whether LLVM is asked to produce a debug build (not performant, but quicker to produce) or a release build (fully optimised, takes longer).

I'm saying my fear that they might isn't unfounded * To Prevent Unfair and Unfounded Ratings: Uber could argue that some riders misuse the rating system. They might give a driver a low rating for reasons outside of the driver's control, such as traffic, a bad mood, or a simple misunderstanding. This policy would be presented as a way to protect drivers from being unfairly penalized, which could affect their livelihood. * To Combat ""Rating Terrorism"" or Coercion: A rider might threaten a driver with a low rating to get a free ride, demand an unscheduled stop, or force them to violate a rule. By banning riders who frequently give low scores, Uber would be taking a stance against this kind of behavior, ensuring that the rating system is used as a genuine feedback mechanism, not a tool for coercion. * To Discourage ""Troll"" Behavior: Some users might be incentivized to give consistently low ratings just to cause trouble or get attention, a practice often referred to as ""trolling."" This policy would be framed as a way to filter out users who are not participating in the community in good faith and are instead just trying to cause problems. * To Maintain Driver Confidence in the Platform: Drivers rely on their ratings to maintain their account status. If they feel that riders are unfairly giving them low scores without consequence, they may become disillusioned with the platform and switch to a competitor. Banning riders who give consistently low ratings would be a way to show drivers that Uber has their back. * To Improve Service by Identifying and Removing ""Unreasonable"" Riders: Uber could frame this as a data-driven approach. They might claim that their internal data shows a small percentage of riders who give low ratings to virtually every driver, regardless of the quality of the service. By removing these outliers, they would be improving the overall efficiency and health of the marketplace for the vast majority of drivers and riders. The goal would be to cultivate a community of ""reasonable"" users who understand and use the ratings system as it was intended.

I kind of wish the app would let me set a driver preference. I'd chose (*) drive at the speed limit. Don't break any laws.

45112720,"Lit: a library for building fast, lightweight web components",45117006,jfagnani,"Lots of comments in here are about shadow DOM, so let me give my take in one place: Yes, Lit uses shadow DOM by default (for good reasons, I think!) and yes you can turn it off component-by-component, but that does bring some challenges. Shadow DOM is most fundamentally just a private branch of the DOM tree for a component's internal DOM details. Frameworks have this implicitly with DOM defined in a component's template vs passed as children. But that distinction isn't visible to other code, the browser, and CSS. This is both good and bad. The biggest thing this separate tree gives us is the ability to tell what nodes are ""children"" - those are the light DOM children. Once you can separate children from internals, you can build slots. Slots are holes in the internals that children get rendered into. Without something like shadow DOM you can't have slots. And without slots you don't have interoperable composition and you don't have viable container elements. You need some way to place children in an element that isn't confused with the element's own DOM. So to me, before encapsulation and style scoping, interoperable composition is the most important feature, and that's really why Lit defaults to shadow DOM on. Without it we'd need some special `.children` property and Lit's component composition suddenly wouldn't be compatible with everyone else. But the style encapsulation is often a major pain for developers, especially if they're trying to integrate web components into an existing system with whole-page stylesheets. It's a big blocker to a lot of design systems porting to web components. That's one reason I proposed something called ""Open Styleable Shadow Roots""[1] which would let styles from outer scopes cascade into a shadow root - a way to break open style encapsulation but keep slots. It's been hard convincing browser vendors that this is needed, but I'm holding out hope that it makes progress soon.

On the consumer side there is no difference, because they consume Web Components, and that is what both solutions deliver. On the implementation side, I can think of a few differences: Vue is more of a ""framework"" solution and has more things built-in. You can do the same things with Lit, but the implementation would look different, because you'd lean more on native APIs. A good example of that is the event model, Vue has some event model built in, but with Lit you would use EventTarget.dispatchEvent(). Lit is a runtime solution, it doesn't require a build and you can  load your source directly in the browser. Vue on the other hand requires some form of compiler stage to produce something your browser can use. Compilers these days are fast, and Lit is specifically engineered to not have runtime performance overhead, so in practice this difference is rather minor. It is a very fundamental difference, so I think it's worth pointing out. Vue can compile to other targets. If you are only delivering Web Components, this is mostly irrelevant, but in theory a consumer might be able to use the Vue components directly in their Vue project, which might give them a better DX. On the other hand, Lit is specifically designed to produce Web Components, so you'll probably have a bit less friction compares to using Vue, e.g when some Vue concept doesn't compile cleanly to Web Components. Is there a major benefit to choosing one implementation over the other? I don't think so, unless you have a very particular requirement that one of them addresses that the other doesn't. For nearly all cases, it is just a different implementation syntax.

No, it's not ""HTML-like"". It's valid HTML. Not that it matters much. You bring this up all the time but I'm not sure what the actual criticism is. Developers seem to understand the small syntax carve-out just fine. No, there are no custom JavaScript rules. Templates have some rules. I'm not sure why they wouldn't? In general you can't make things like tag and attribute names dynamic because you can't change them in HTML. You can actually write the template you show with what we call static templates though. `classMap()` is a template directive. It has some rules about how it's used in templates, just like other JS functions can have rules about how their used. I'm not sure what makes that not a function.

I am significantly less confident that an LLM is going to be any good at putting a raw source like a court ruling PDF into context and adequately explain to readers why - and what details - of the decision matter, and what impact they will have. They can probably do an OK job summarizing the document, but not much more. I do agree that given current trends there is going to be significant impact to journalism, and I don’t like that future at all.

I use all the major LLM systems, mostly with their most expensive models, and when I ask them for sources, including specifically in many cases sources for legal questions, half the time the linked source will not be remotely irrelevant, and will not remotely substantiate the claim that it is being cited for. Almost never is it without an error of some significance. They all still hallucinate very consistently if you’re actually pushing them into areas that are complicated and non-obvious, when they can’t figure out an answer, they make one up. The reduction in apparent hallucinations in a recent models seems to be more that they’ve learned specific cases where they should say they don’t know, not that the problem has been solved in a broader sense. This is true for first party applications, as well as for custom integrations, where I can explicitly check that the context should be grounding them with all of the relevant facts. It doesn’t matter, that isn’t enough, you can tell me I’m holding it wrong, but we’ve consulted with experts from anthropic and from OpenAI and who have done major AI integrations at some of the most prominent AI consuming companies. I’m not holding it wrong. It’s just a horribly flawed piece of technology that must be used with extreme thoughtfulness if you want to do anything non-trivial without massive risks. I remain convinced that the people who can’t see the massive flaws in current LLM systems must be negligently incompetent in how they perform their jobs. I use LLM’s every day in my work and they are a great help to my productivity, but learning to use them effectively is all about understanding the countless ways in which they fail and thinks that they cannot be relied on for and understanding where they actually provide value. They do provide value for me in legal research, because sometimes they point me in the direction of caselaw or legal considerations that hadn’t occurred to me. But the majority of the time, the vast majority, their summaries are incorrect, and their arguments are invalid. LLMs are not capable of reasoning which requires non-obvious jumps of logic which are more than one small step removed from the example that they’ve seen in their training. If you attempt to use them to reason about a legal situation, you will immediately see themselves tie themselves in not because they are not capable of that kind of reasoning, on top of their inability to actually understand in summarize case documents and statutes accurately. reply","what condescending nonsense is this? i use all the major llm systems, mostly with their most expensive models, and when i ask them for sources, including specifically in many cases sources for legal questions, half the time the linked source will not be remotely irrelevant, and will not remotely substantiate the claim that it is being cited for. almost never is it without an error of some significance. they all still hallucinate very consistently if you’re actually pushing them into areas that are complicated and non-obvious, when they can’t figure out an answer, they make one up. the reduction in apparent hallucinations in a recent models seems to be more that they’ve learned specific cases where they should say they don’t know, not that the problem has been solved in a broader sense. this is true for first party applications, as well as for custom integrations, where i can explicitly check that the context should be grounding them with all of the relevant facts. it doesn’t matter, that isn’t enough, you can tell me i’m holding it wrong, but we’ve consulted with experts from anthropic and from openai and who have done major ai integrations at some of the most prominent ai consuming companies. i’m not holding it wrong. it’s just a horribly flawed piece of technology that must be used with extreme thoughtfulness if you want to do anything non-trivial without massive risks. i remain convinced that the people who can’t see the massive flaws in current llm systems must be negligently incompetent in how they perform their jobs. i use llm’s every day in my work and they are a great help to my productivity, but learning to use them effectively is all about understanding the countless ways in which they fail and thinks that they cannot be relied on for and understanding where they actually provide value. they do provide value for me in legal research, because sometimes they point me in the direction of caselaw or legal considerations that hadn’t occurred to me. but the majority of the time, the vast majority, their summaries are incorrect, and their arguments are invalid. llms are not capable of reasoning which requires non-obvious jumps of logic which are more than one small step removed from the example that they’ve seen in their training. if you attempt to use them to reason about a legal situation, you will immediately see themselves tie themselves in not because they are not capable of that kind of reasoning, on top of their inability to actually understand in summarize case documents and statutes accurately. reply","['condescending', 'nonsense', 'use', 'major', 'llm', 'systems', 'mostly', 'expensive', 'models', 'ask', 'sources', 'including', 'specifically', 'many', 'cases', 'sources', 'legal', 'questions', 'half', 'time', 'linked', 'source', 'remotely', 'irrelevant', 'remotely', 'substantiate', 'claim', 'cited', 'almost', 'never', 'without', 'error', 'significance', 'still', 'hallucinate', 'consistently', 'actually', 'pushing', 'areas', 'complicated', 'nonobvious', 'figure', 'answer', 'make', 'one', 'reduction', 'apparent', 'hallucinations', 'recent', 'models', 'seems', 'learned', 'specific', 'cases', 'say', 'know', 'problem', 'solved', 'broader', 'sense', 'true', 'first', 'party', 'applications', 'well', 'custom', 'integrations', 'explicitly', 'check', 'context', 'grounding', 'relevant', 'facts', 'matter', 'enough', 'tell', 'holding', 'wrong', 'consulted', 'experts', 'anthropic', 'openai', 'done', 'major', 'ai', 'integrations', 'prominent', 'ai', 'consuming', 'companies', 'holding', 'wrong', 'horribly', 'flawed', 'piece', 'technology', 'must', 'used', 'extreme', 'thoughtfulness', 'want', 'anything', 'nontrivial', 'without', 'massive', 'risks', 'remain', 'convinced', 'people', 'see', 'massive', 'flaws', 'current', 'llm', 'systems', 'must', 'negligently', 'incompetent', 'perform', 'jobs', 'use', 'llm', 'every', 'day', 'work', 'great', 'help', 'productivity', 'learning', 'use', 'effectively', 'understanding', 'countless', 'ways', 'fail', 'thinks', 'relied', 'understanding', 'actually', 'provide', 'value', 'provide', 'value', 'legal', 'research', 'sometimes', 'point', 'direction', 'caselaw', 'legal', 'considerations', 'occurred', 'majority', 'time', 'vast', 'majority', 'summaries', 'incorrect', 'arguments', 'invalid', 'llms', 'capable', 'reasoning', 'requires', 'nonobvious', 'jumps', 'logic', 'one', 'small', 'step', 'removed', 'example', 'seen', 'training', 'attempt', 'use', 'reason', 'legal', 'situation', 'immediately', 'see', 'tie', 'capable', 'kind', 'reasoning', 'top', 'inability', 'actually', 'understand', 'summarize', 'case', 'documents', 'statutes', 'accurately', 'reply']",0.8983

Not such a problem now, but I think we may see more of this once AI is firmly embedded into every information flow. Currently the AI company game is training people to trust the machine. Once they do, what a resource those people become! Now, none of those points are unique to LLMs: inaccuracy, misunderstanding, wrong or confused synthesis and especially bias are all common in human journalism. Gell-Mann amnesia and institutional bias and all that. Perhaps the problem is that I'm not sufficiently mistrustful of the status quo, even though I am already quite suspicious of journalistic analysis. Or maybe it's because AI, though my brain screams ""don't trust it, check everything, find the source"", remains in the toolbox even when I find problems, whereas for a journalist I'd roll my eyes, call them a hack and leave the website. Not that it's directly relevant to the immediate utility of AI today, but once AI is everything, or almost everything, then my next worry is what happens when you functionally only have published primary material and AI output to train on. Even without model collapse, what happens when AI journobots inherently don't ""pick up the phone"", so to speak, to dig up details? For the first year, the media runs almost for free.

Google LLC, Google is required to adhere to a series of remedies aimed at curbing its monopolistic practices in the search and search advertising markets. These remedies address Google's distribution agreements, data sharing, and advertising practices. Distribution Agreements A central component of the remedies focuses on Google's distribution agreements to ensure they are not shutting out competitors: No Exclusive Contracts Google is barred from entering into or maintaining exclusive contracts for the distribution of Google Search, Chrome, Google Assistant, and the Gemini app. No Tying Arrangements Google cannot condition the licensing of the Play Store or any other Google application on the preloading or placement of its other products like Search or Chrome. Revenue Sharing Conditions The company is prohibited from conditioning revenue-sharing payments on the exclusive placement of its applications. Partner Freedom Distribution partners are now free to simultaneously distribute competing general search engines (GSEs), browsers, or generative AI products. Contract Duration Agreements with browser developers, OEMs, and wireless carriers for default placement of Google products are limited to a one-year term. Data Sharing and Syndication To address the competitive advantages Google gained through its exclusionary conduct, the court has ordered the following: Search Data Access Google must provide ""Qualified Competitors"" with access to certain search index and user-interaction data to help them improve their services. This does not, however, include advertising data. Syndication Services Google is required to offer search and search text ad syndication services to qualified competitors on ordinary commercial terms. This will enable smaller firms to provide high-quality search results and ads while they build out their own capabilities. Advertising Transparency To promote greater transparency in the search advertising market, the court has mandated that: Public Disclosure Google must publicly disclose significant changes to its ad auction processes. This is intended to prevent Google from secretly adjusting its ad auctions to increase prices. What Google is NOT Required to Do The court also specified several remedies it would not impose: No Divestiture Google is not required to sell off its Chrome browser or the Android operating system. No Payment Ban Google can continue to make payments to distribution partners for the preloading or placement of its products. The court reasoned that a ban could harm these partners and consumers. No Choice Screens The court will not force Google to present users with choice screens on its products or on Android devices, citing a desire to avoid dictating product design. No Sharing of Granular Ad Data Google is not required to share detailed, query-level advertising data with advertisers.

Assuming we're talking about the AI generated blurbs at the top of search results, there are loads of problems. For one they frequently don't load at all. For another search is an awkward place for them to be. I interact with search differently than with a chat interface where you're embedding a query in a kind of conversational context such that both your query and the answer are rich in contextual meaning. With search I'm typically more fact finding and in a fight against Google's page rank optimizations to try and break through to get my information I need. In a search context AI prompts don't benefit from context rich prompts and aren't able to give context-rich answers and kind of give generic background that isn't necessarily what I asked for. To really benefit from the search prompts I would have to be using the search bar in a prompt way, which would likely degrade the search results. And generally this hybrid interaction is not very natural or easy to optimize, and we all know nobody is asking for it, it's just bolted on to neutralize the temptation to leave search behind in favor of an LLM chat.

From page 157: ""Glue is essentially a super query log that collects a raft of data about a query and the users interaction with the response. Rem. Tr. at 2808:22809:6 (Allan). The data underlying Glue consists of information relating to (1) the query, such as its text, language, user location, and user device type; (2) ranking information, including the 10 blue links and any other triggered search features that appear on the SERP, such as images, maps, Knowledge Panel, People also ask, etc.; (3) SERP interaction information, such as clicks, hovers, and duration on the SERP; and (4) query interpretation and suggestions, including spelling correction and salient query terms. Id. at 2809:82812:20 (Allan) (discussing RDXD-20.026 to .028). An important component of the Glue data is Navboost data. See id. at 2808:16-20 (Allan) (Glue contains . . . Nav[b]oost information.); Liab. Tr. at 6403:3-5 (Nayak) (Glue is just another name for [N]avboost that includes all of the other features on the page.). Navboost is a memorization system that aggregates click-and-query data about the web results delivered to the SERP. Liab. Tr. at 1804:81805:22, 1806:8-15 (Lehman). Like Glue, it can be thought of as just a giant table. Id. at 1805:6-13 (Lehman). Importantly, the remedy does not force Google to disclose any models or signals built from Glue data, only the underlying data itself. Rem. Tr. at 2809:3-4 (Allan)."" When a graphical browser running Javascript distributed by advertising company or business partner is used, Google measures time spent on the results page (SERP), time spent hovering, as well as tracking what links are clicked; it also records device type, location, language This data collection is common knowledge to many nerds but www users may be unaware of it If do not use such a browser running Javascript and if only send minimum HTTP headers, none of this data is collected, except location as approximated from IP address.  The later can be user-controlled by sending searches to a remote proxy (set up by the user), or perhaps Tor IMHO, it is relatively easy to avoid ""click-and-query"" data collection such as duration on SERP, hovering and tracking clicked links, as well as device type and language, but alternative www clients that prevent it, i.e., not the browser distributed by Google, are not made available as a choice.  With this settlement, Google can no longer restrict others from offering choice of alternative www clients reply","the opinion: from page 157: ""glue is essentially a super query log that collects a raft of data about a query and the users interaction with the response. rem. tr. at 2808:22809:6 (allan). the data underlying glue consists of information relating to (1) the query, such as its text, language, user location, and user device type; (2) ranking information, including the 10 blue links and any other triggered search features that appear on the serp, such as images, maps, knowledge panel, people also ask, etc.; (3) serp interaction information, such as clicks, hovers, and duration on the serp; and (4) query interpretation and suggestions, including spelling correction and salient query terms. id. at 2809:82812:20 (allan) (discussing rdxd-20.026 to .028). an important component of the glue data is navboost data. see id. at 2808:16-20 (allan) (glue contains . . . nav[b]oost information.); liab. tr. at 6403:3-5 (nayak) (glue is just another name for [n]avboost that includes all of the other features on the page.). navboost is a memorization system that aggregates click-and-query data about the web results delivered to the serp. liab. tr. at 1804:81805:22, 1806:8-15 (lehman). like glue, it can be thought of as just a giant table. id. at 1805:6-13 (lehman). importantly, the remedy does not force google to disclose any models or signals built from glue data, only the underlying data itself. rem. tr. at 2809:3-4 (allan)."" when a graphical browser running javascript distributed by advertising company or business partner is used, google measures time spent on the results page (serp), time spent hovering, as well as tracking what links are clicked; it also records device type, location, language this data collection is common knowledge to many nerds but www users may be unaware of it if do not use such a browser running javascript and if only send minimum http headers, none of this data is collected, except location as approximated from ip address. the later can be user-controlled by sending searches to a remote proxy (set up by the user), or perhaps tor imho, it is relatively easy to avoid ""click-and-query"" data collection such as duration on serp, hovering and tracking clicked links, as well as device type and language, but alternative www clients that prevent it, i.e., not the browser distributed by google, are not made available as a choice. with this settlement, google can no longer restrict others from offering choice of alternative www clients reply","['opinion', 'page', 'glue', 'essentially', 'super', 'query', 'log', 'collects', 'raft', 'data', 'query', 'users', 'interaction', 'response', 'rem', 'tr', 'allan', 'data', 'underlying', 'glue', 'consists', 'information', 'relating', 'query', 'text', 'language', 'user', 'location', 'user', 'device', 'type', 'ranking', 'information', 'including', 'blue', 'links', 'triggered', 'search', 'features', 'appear', 'serp', 'images', 'maps', 'knowledge', 'panel', 'people', 'ask', 'etc', 'serp', 'interaction', 'information', 'clicks', 'hovers', 'duration', 'serp', 'query', 'interpretation', 'suggestions', 'including', 'spelling', 'correction', 'salient', 'query', 'terms', 'id', 'allan', 'discussing', 'rdxd20026', 'important', 'component', 'glue', 'data', 'navboost', 'data', 'see', 'id', 'allan', 'glue', 'contains', 'nav', 'b', 'oost', 'information', 'liab', 'tr', 'nayak', 'glue', 'another', 'name', 'n', 'avboost', 'includes', 'features', 'page', 'navboost', 'memorization', 'system', 'aggregates', 'clickandquery', 'data', 'web', 'results', 'delivered', 'serp', 'liab', 'tr', 'lehman', 'glue', 'thought', 'giant', 'table', 'id', 'lehman', 'importantly', 'remedy', 'force', 'google', 'disclose', 'models', 'signals', 'built', 'glue', 'data', 'underlying', 'data', 'rem', 'tr', 'allan', 'graphical', 'browser', 'running', 'javascript', 'distributed', 'advertising', 'company', 'business', 'partner', 'used', 'google', 'measures', 'time', 'spent', 'results', 'page', 'serp', 'time', 'spent', 'hovering', 'well', 'tracking', 'links', 'clicked', 'records', 'device', 'type', 'location', 'language', 'data', 'collection', 'common', 'knowledge', 'many', 'nerds', 'www', 'users', 'may', 'unaware', 'use', 'browser', 'running', 'javascript', 'send', 'minimum', 'http', 'headers', 'none', 'data', 'collected', 'except', 'location', 'approximated', 'ip', 'address', 'later', 'usercontrolled', 'sending', 'searches', 'remote', 'proxy', 'set', 'user', 'perhaps', 'tor', 'imho', 'relatively', 'easy', 'avoid', 'clickandquery', 'data', 'collection', 'duration', 'serp', 'hovering', 'tracking', 'clicked', 'links', 'well', 'device', 'type', 'language', 'alternative', 'www', 'clients', 'prevent', 'ie', 'browser', 'distributed', 'google', 'made', 'available', 'choice', 'settlement', 'google', 'longer', 'restrict', 'others', 'offering', 'choice', 'alternative', 'www', 'clients', 'reply']",0.4215
